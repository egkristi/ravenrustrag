# RavenRustRAG — Licensing

RavenRustRAG uses a **dual-license model**: open source for the community,
commercial for enterprise use.

---

## Open Source Core — AGPLv3

RavenRustRAG is licensed under the
[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSES/AGPLv3.txt) (AGPLv3).

This covers all features:
- Semantic vector search with cosine similarity
- Embedding backends (Ollama, OpenAI, pluggable)
- Embedding cache with fingerprint deduplication
- Token-aware and character-based chunking
- File loaders (txt, md, csv, json, jsonl, html)
- JSONL export/import
- CLI tool (`raven`)
- HTTP API server (Axum)
- MCP server for AI assistants
- SQLite and in-memory vector stores

**AGPLv3 in plain English:**
- Free to use, modify, and distribute
- If you modify and run it as a service (SaaS), you must publish your modifications
- If you distribute it as part of a product, that product must also be AGPLv3
- Protects against cloud providers silently forking and offering as managed service

---

## Commercial License — Enterprise

A commercial license is required if you:

1. Distribute RavenRustRAG inside a product **without** releasing your source under AGPLv3
2. Offer RavenRustRAG as a **hosted/managed service** without releasing modifications

A commercial license grants:
- Usage rights without AGPLv3 obligations
- Priority support and SLA options

See [LICENSES/COMMERCIAL.txt](LICENSES/COMMERCIAL.txt) for full terms.

## Why AGPLv3?

We chose AGPLv3 over MIT/Apache 2.0 deliberately:

**The SaaS loophole:** MIT and Apache 2.0 allow cloud providers to take RavenRustRAG,
add proprietary features, and offer it as a managed service without contributing back.
AGPLv3 closes this loophole — if you run it as a service, your modifications
must be open.

**We commit to the core staying open:** The core will remain AGPLv3 forever.
Enterprise features that we build on top may be commercial,
but the foundation will not be.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
This allows us to offer the commercial license while accepting community contributions.

The CLA grants us the right to:
- Include your contribution in the AGPLv3 release
- Include your contribution in commercial releases

It does NOT transfer copyright ownership. You retain copyright over your contributions.
